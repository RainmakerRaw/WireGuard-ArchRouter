# Add a VPN routing table:

echo "10 vpn" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables

# Next, add the following policy rule for the LAN interface you want to route via VPN:

ip rule add unicast iif enp3s0f0 table vpn

# This rule effectively says "if the packet comes in on interface ens192, use routing table vpn".

# You can check the rules with ip rule show:

# ip rule show
# 0:      from all lookup local 
# 32765:  from all iif eth1 lookup vpn 
# 32766:  from all lookup main 
# 32767:  from all lookup default

#The rules are applied in ascending order, until a rule matches. If a packet is received on interface ens192, rule 32765 matches, else the next rules are tried.

#You can now add routes to the vpn routing table. For example, to add a default route (from LAN subnet on ens192) to your tunnel:

ip route add default dev azirevpn-uk1 via 10.20.13.71 table vpn
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.2.1 dev enp3s0f1 table vpn

# To print the vpn routing table, use

ip route show table vpn
