# This allows you to tunnel only one subnet (physical interface) and leave the other - i.e. DMZ - attached directly to the internet. 
# It's not necessary to do this manually as the wg-up.sh script does it for us. I add this for reference, and to show how it works.
# First, add a VPN routing table:

echo "10 vpn" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables

# Next, add the following policy rule for the LAN interface you want to route via VPN:

ip rule add unicast iif [LAN interface] table vpn

# This rule tells the system that any traffic coming in from LAN interface xyz should look to table VPN for its routes.

# You can check the rules with ip rule show:

ip rule show
0:      from all lookup local 
32765:  from all iif xyz lookup vpn 
32766:  from all lookup main 
32767:  from all lookup default

#The rules are applied in ascending order, until a rule matches. If a packet is received on interface xyz, rule 32765 matches, else the next rules are tried.

#You can now add routes to the vpn routing table. For example, to add a default route (from LAN subnet on xyz) to your tunnel:

ip route add default dev azirevpn-uk1 via 10.20.xx.xx table vpn
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.2.1 dev [DMZ interface] table vpn

# To print the vpn routing table so you can check it, use

ip route show table vpn
