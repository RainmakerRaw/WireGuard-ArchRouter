# DNAT port forwards - add more as required, following this template. It's necessary to add the loc and dmz entries to allow local clients to also access your servers (via local IP or domain name) from inside the network. Adding only the 'net' entry would only allow access to people outside your network, unless you enable hairpin NAT. This solution is better, as hairpin NAT necessitates putting local traffic through the firewall as though it came from outside.
